# Runbook

This runbook has three major sections:
1. Setup, getting from 0 to where I'm currently at
2. Maintenance, how to modify and extend functionality
3. Troubleshooting, ways I've found to diagnose and solve issues efficiently

This is quite a long document, so I advise you *Ctrl+F* for your desired section and/or keyword.
